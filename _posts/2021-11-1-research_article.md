# Questions and answers about the scientific student
 
1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses?
	* The null hyposthesis is that 
	* The alternative hypothsis is that
2. Who is collecting and analyzing this data?
	* The data was collected and analyzed by a team of researchers from the Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel. Their research was supported by European Research Council as well as a variety of other organizations. Some data was also collected from references and was used to help analyze the data collected. They also state in the Contributions section that Emily Elhacham performed the bulk of the research and data analysis and tell us what the roles of the other researchers were.
3. What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?
	* This study uses a variety of datasets inluding a collected dataset, an Anthropogenic mass dataset from a reference, a dataset called TRENDY Dynamic Global Vegetation Models outputs, a dataset called Leaves dry matter content measurements, and they issued a statement that "other datasets used in this study are available from the published literature, as detailed in the Methods and Supplementary Information." All of the data used in the study is available on GitHub. It can also be implied that anything not avaiable on GitHub is avaiable in other studies.
4. Why are they interested in this data?
	* They are interested in this data because they believe that Earth is at a crossover point when the anthropogenic mass will surpass all global living biomass. The data collected and analyzed helps us understand how this happened and what it means.
5. What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?
	* Answer
6. What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?
	* Answer
7. How was this study funded?
	* This study was funded by the European Research Council (Project NOVCARBFIX 646827); Beck-Canadian Center for Alternative Energy Research; Dana and Yossie Hollander; Ullmann Family Foundation; Helmsley Charitable Foundation; Larson Charitable Foundation; Wolfson Family Charitable Trust; Charles Rothschild; and Selmo Nussenbaum. The aknowledgements also mention S. Sitch and the TRENDY DGVM community, thanking them for access to their simulation outputs.
8. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?
	* Answer
